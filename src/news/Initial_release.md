Initial builds for Overte have been released. Features include live authentication/world directory server switching, and a complete replacement of Vircadia's Explore app.

New Places app, which replaces Explore app has several features making it easier and more enjoyable to use:

* Support for multiple world directory servers.
* A new, cleaner user interface for browsing places and domains.
* Ability to filter domains by user presence or maturity rating.
